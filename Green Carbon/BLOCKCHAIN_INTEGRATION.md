3. Get some Sepolia ETH from a faucet:
   - https://sepoliafaucet.com/
   - https://faucet.sepolia.dev/

### 2. Add Sepolia Network
The app will automatically prompt you to switch to Sepolia, but you can add it manually:
- **Network Name**: Sepolia
- **RPC URL**: https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/9aa3d95b3bc440fa88ea12eaa4456161
- **Chain ID**: 11155111
- **Currency Symbol**: ETH
- **Block Explorer**: https://sepolia.etherscan.io

### 3. Environment Configuration
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update if needed:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

5. Click "View on Explorer" for detailed transaction info

## Transaction Flow

```
1. Project Submission (Off-chain)
   ↓
2. Government Review (Off-chain)
   ↓
3. Project Approval (On-chain) ← Blockchain Transaction
   ↓
4. Carbon Credit Minting (On-chain) ← Blockchain Transaction
   ↓
5. Credits in Government Wallet (On-chain)
```

## Technical Details

### Blockchain Service
- `src/services/blockchainService.ts` - Main blockchain interaction service
- Handles contract calls, transaction management, and error handling
- Provides transaction status tracking and history

### Wallet Integration
- `src/components/blockchain/WalletConnection.tsx` - Wallet connection UI
- `src/components/blockchain/TransactionStatus.tsx` - Transaction status display
- Real-time connection and network status

### Configuration
- `src/config/blockchain.ts` - Contract addresses, ABIs, and network config
- Environment variables for easy deployment configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MetaMask not detected**
   - Ensure MetaMask is installed and enabled
   - Refresh the page and try again

2. **Wrong network**
   - Click "Switch to Sepolia" button
   - Or manually switch in MetaMask

3. **Insufficient funds**
   - Get test ETH from Sepolia faucet
   - Need ETH for gas fees

4. **Transaction failed**
   - Check if you have enough ETH for gas
   - Ensure you're on the correct network
   - Try increasing gas limit in MetaMask

5. **Contract not responding**
   - Contracts are deployed on Sepolia testnet
   - Check network status and try again

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important**: This is a testnet implementation for demonstration purposes.

- Never use mainnet private keys for testing
- Always verify contract addresses before interacting
- Test thoroughly before any mainnet deployment
- Keep private keys secure and never share them
