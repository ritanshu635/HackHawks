   ./gradlew installDebug
   ```

## 🌍 Usage Guide

### For Farmers (Green Carbon)

1. **Register Land**
   - Select "Green Carbon" from home screen
   - Fill in land details (name, type, address)
   - Choose boundary marking method:
     - **Map Drawing**: Draw boundary on map
     - **AR Walking**: Walk the boundary with AR guidance

2. **Plant Identification**
   - After land registration, you'll be prompted to identify plants
   - Take a clear photo of your main crop/tree
   - AI will identify the plant and calculate carbon credits
   - View estimated annual income from carbon credits

3. **Dashboard**
   - View all registered lands
   - See plant information and carbon credit projections
   - Track total carbon credits and estimated earnings

### For NGOs (Blue Carbon)

1. **NGO Registration**
   - Select "Blue Carbon" from home screen
   - Complete NGO verification process
   - Register coastal restoration projects

2. **Project Management**
   - Add coastal land areas
   - Track restoration progress
   - Monitor carbon sequestration

### AI Assistant

- **Voice Commands**: Tap "Speak" and ask questions about carbon credits
- **Text Chat**: Type questions for instant AI responses
- **Multi-language**: Supports Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, and more

## 🧮 Carbon Credit Calculations

The app uses scientific formulas to calculate carbon credits:

### Plant Types & Rates
- **Trees**: 10-50 kg CO₂/year → 1-5 credits/hectare/year
- **Crops**: 5-20 kg CO₂/year → 0.5-2 credits/hectare/year
- **Shrubs**: 2-10 kg CO₂/year → 0.2-1 credits/hectare/year
- **Bamboo**: 20-60 kg CO₂/year → 2-6 credits/hectare/year

### Factors Considered
- Plant type and species
- Land area (hectares)
- Soil quality (poor/medium/good)
- Irrigation type (rainfed/irrigated/drip)
- Regional climate conditions

### Economic Projections
- Current market rate: ~$15 per ton CO₂
- 5-year and 10-year projections included
- Growth factors applied for maturing plants

## 🔧 Configuration

### Customizing Plant Database
Edit `PlantIdentificationClient.kt` to modify:
- Plant identification prompts
- Carbon absorption rates
- Credit calculation formulas

### Adding Languages
Update language mappings in:
- `AIAssistantManager.kt` (speech recognition)
- `ElevenLabsTTS.kt` (text-to-speech voices)

### Adjusting Carbon Rates
Modify `CarbonCreditCalculator.kt`:
- Update `PLANT_TYPE_MULTIPLIERS`
- Adjust `CREDIT_PRICE_PER_TON_USD`
- Change regional multipliers

## 🕶️ AR Implementation Status & Guide

**AR (Augmented Reality)** is a key feature of Farmers App allowing users to physically walk around their land to mark boundaries while the app tracks their path, logs GPS coordinates, and calculates the area.

### Current Implementation Status
The AR functionality is currently a **placeholder** in `ARBoundaryScreen.kt`. The basic screen structure, permission handling, area/perimeter calculations, and map fallback are implemented, but a full ARCore session needs to be added.

✅ AR screen structure created
✅ Permission handling added
✅ Area/perimeter calculation implemented
✅ Fallback to map option available


### Next Steps for AR Implementation

**Option 1: Use ARCore (Recommended)**
Add Google's AR framework to handle precise real-world tracking. You will need to create an `ArSession`, track device position, mark coordinates at intervals, and visualize the path in AR.

**Option 2: Use SceneView Library**
For easier integration with Compose, utilize the `SceneView` library (`io.github.sceneview:arsceneview`).

**Option 3: Simplified GPS-Only Approach**
If ARCore is complex or unsupported by target devices, implement a GPS-tracking only solution without AR visualization.

See [ARCore Documentation](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop) or [SceneView Library](https://github.com/SceneView/sceneview-android) for further guidance.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Errors**
   ```bash
   # Clean and rebuild
   ./gradlew clean
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

2. **API Key Issues**
   - Verify keys are correctly set in `gradle.properties`
   - Check API key permissions and quotas
   - Ensure no extra spaces in key values

3. **Plant Identification Not Working**
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify OpenAI/OpenRouter API key
   - Try with different image (clear, well-lit plant photos work best)

4. **Voice Assistant Issues**
   - Grant microphone permissions
   - Check device audio settings
   - Ensure internet connection for AI responses

5. **GPS/Location Issues**
   - Enable location permissions
   - Use device outdoors for better GPS signal
   - Check location services are enabled
